This is a Local Library written in Express.JS (Node.JS framework) in the backend.
We also use MongoDB database and Mongoose for querying the database.

On the frontend, we use PUG templating engine and Bootstrap.

The aim of this application is to demonstrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations with one-to-many relationships between models. We have however, intentionally excluded user authentication/authorization.
